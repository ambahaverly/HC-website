<p class="intro-line">Expert housing finance advice, when you need it.</p>
<p>Managing housing finance in a local authority has never been more complex. From the pressures of the Housing Revenue Account to the growing cost of temporary accommodation and the governance demands of housing companies, finance teams are being asked to do more with less.</p>
<p>The Advisory Partnership gives your council direct, on-demand access to specialist housing finance expertise, without the cost and commitment of a full-time hire. Through a simple annual subscription, you get unlimited access to our consultants across the areas that matter most.</p>
<h2>What the partnership covers</h2>
<ul class="scope">
<li><b>Housing Revenue Account</b><span>Business planning, rent setting, self-financing, capital financing strategies, headroom analysis and 30-year plan modelling.</span></li>
<li><b>Homelessness and temporary accommodation</b><span>General Fund cost pressures, acquisition and funding strategies, and budget management.</span></li>
<li><b>Local authority housing companies</b><span>Governance, financial modelling, dividend strategies, and compliance with IFRS 16 and other accounting standards.</span></li>

<h2>Why councils choose a subscription</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost-effective.</strong> A fraction of the cost of recruiting or retaining a specialist in-house.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate access.</strong> No procurement delays, no scoping exercises, no waiting for a project to be approved.</li>
<li><strong>Broad expertise.</strong> Our team has worked across district, borough, county and unitary authorities.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity.</strong> Your account is supported by the same consultants, who build deep knowledge of your organisation over time.</li>
